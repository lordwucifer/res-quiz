#This is a trivia game about Paul Resnick! Make additions, modifications, and deletions as necessary.
#The code is purposefully buggy. Refer to PS6 with the hangman game to fix this one!
#Ideas for changes: what happens when the user enters something other than true or false, more trivia, different wording, tests
